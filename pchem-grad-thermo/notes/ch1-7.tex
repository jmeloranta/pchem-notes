\otitle{1.7 Other thermodynamic functions}

\otext

Recall from classical thermodynamics (Legendre transformations) that the following thermodynamic functions were defined:

\ceqn{1.46}{H = U + PV\textnormal{ (enthalpy)}}{A = U - TS\textnormal{ (Helmoltz energy)}}{G = H - TS = U + PV - TS \textnormal{ (Gibbs energy)}}

Since $V$, $T$, and $n$ are constant in canonical ensemble and expressions for $U$, $P$, and $S$ were derived previously, $H$, $A$, and $G$ can be obtained.

Below is a summary of the results based on Eq. (\ref{eq1.46}):

\aeqn{1.47}{H = kT^2\left(\frac{\partial\ln(Z)}{\partial T}\right)_{V,n} + VkT\left(\frac{\partial\ln(Z)}{\partial V}\right)_{T,n}}

\aeqn{1.48}{A = -kT\ln(Z)}

\aeqn{1.49}{G = VkT\left(\frac{\partial\ln(Z)}{\partial V}\right)_{T,n} - kT\ln(Z)}
