Representation of $Y_{l,m_l}$ on a unit sphere. $Y_{l,m_l}$ is equal to 0 (i.e. \textit{angular node}) along $m_l$ great circles passing through the poles, and along $l-m_l$ circles of equal latitude. The function changes sign each time it crosses one of these lines. Note that it is possible to create rotational wavepackets, which have a well defined orientation.
