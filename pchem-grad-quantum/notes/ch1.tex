\textbf{Operators in quantum mechanics}

\textit{Observable}: Any dynamical variable of the system that can be measured. In classical mechanics these are represented by functions whereas in quantum mechanics they are operators.\\

\vspace*{0.3cm}

\textit{Operator:} Is a symbol that defines a set of mathematical operations that act on a given function. Examples of operators are: multiplication by a constant, differentiation, etc. General operators are denoted by $\Omega$ whereas $H$ is reserved to represent the Hamiltonian operator, which yields the total energy of the system. Sometimes operators are represented with a ``hat'' above them, $\hat{H}$.\\

\textit{The Schr\"odinger equation:} $H\psi = E\psi$.
\end{center}

\vspace*{0.3cm}

This is a linear eigenvalue problem, where $H$ contains typically partial derivatives with respect to the spatial coordinates.
