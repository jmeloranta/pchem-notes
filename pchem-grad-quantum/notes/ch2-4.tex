\otitle{2.4 Penetration into non-classical regions}

\otext
On previous slide we have seen that the probability amplitude $\left|\psi(r)\right|^2$ asymptotically approaces zero when we go far away from the origin. Thus it is necessary that at some point the potential energy will be larger than the energy of the state that the particle is on. This region is forbidden classically as the total energy of the particle is less than the potential energy. It is often said that the particle \textit{penetrates} or \textit{tunnels} into the potential barrier. Most often when referring to quantum mechanical tunneling, we are discussing non-classical extent of the particle probability amplitude on the opposite side of a potential barrier:
