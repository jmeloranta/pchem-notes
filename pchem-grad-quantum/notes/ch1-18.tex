\otitle{1.18 The uncertainty in energy and time}

\otext
Often the uncertainty between energy and time is expressed as:

$$\Delta E\Delta t\ge \hbar$$

However, time is not an observable in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics but just a parameter with no corresponding operator. For this reason Eq. (\ref{eq1.33}) cannot be applied. We will see later what the meaning of this ``uncertainty'' relation is.

Note that this will have important implications to spectroscopy and especially broadening of resonances. For example, consider a simple UV/VIS absorption experiment. When the molecule is promoted to the excited state, there could be some external perturbation that disturbs the excited state and hence ``shortens'' its lifetime. This would result in line broadening in UV/VIS spectrum.
