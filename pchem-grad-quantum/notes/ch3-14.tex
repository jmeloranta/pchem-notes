The energies of hydrogen atom orbitals depdend only on the principal quantum number $n$. This means that each shell $n$ has the following degeneracy factor:

\aeqn{3.52}{g_n = \sum\limits_{l = 0}^{n-1}(2l + 1) = n^2}

Here all $ns$, $np$, $nd$, ... levels have the same energy. Each $np_{x,y,z}$, etc. are clearly related to each other by symmetry but the degeneracy between different $l$ orbitals is due to hidden symmetry. In fact, in many atom molecules this symmetry is broken and only the $m_l$ components belonging to the given $l$ level remain degenerate. The degeneracy between the $m_l$ levels can be removed by applying electric or magnetic field on the system.
