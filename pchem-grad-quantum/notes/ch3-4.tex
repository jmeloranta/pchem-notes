\otext
It is possible to preapre a wavepacket from the rotational eigenfunctions. In this each angular momentum component is written as:

\aeqn{3.15}{\Psi_{m_l} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-m_l\phi - im_l^2\hbar t / (2I)}}

By adding these functions weighted by the shape function (see Eq. (\ref{eq2.13})) we can obtain the rotational wavepacket. An example of a rotational wavepacket is shown below.
