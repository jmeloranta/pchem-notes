\otitle{2.1 \& 2.2 The curvature of the wavefunction \& Qualitative solutions}

\otext
The Schr\"odinger equation can be used to obtain curvature of $\psi$:

$$\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\left(V - E\right)\psi$$

If $(V - E)\psi < 0$ the curvature goes like $\cap$ or $(V - E)\psi > 0$ then $\cup$. Consider, for example, the following:

\ofig{harmonic-pot}{0.3}{}

The curvature is large where the amplitude of $\psi$ is large. The solutions must be such that they tend to zero far away from the origin.
