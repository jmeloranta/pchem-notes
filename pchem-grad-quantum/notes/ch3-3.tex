\otitle{3.3 The shapes of the wavefunctions}

\otext
To understand the shapes of the previous rotational wavefunctions, we expand the complex exponential term:

\aeqn{3.11}{\Psi_{m_l} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi}}e^{im_l\phi} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi}}\left(\cos(m_l\phi) + i\sin(m_l\phi)\right)}

This wavefunction is complex when $m_l \ne 0$. The real and imaginary parts are shown below.

Note that eigenstates with $m_l \ne 0$ are doubly degenerate as the energy depends on $m_l^2$. Furthermore, there is no zero-point energy as the energy for $m_l = 0$ is zero. For all states the probability density is independent of the angle $\phi$:

\aeqn{3.12}{\left|\Phi_{m_l}\right|^2 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi}}e^{-im_l\phi}\sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi}}e^{im_l\phi} = \frac{1}{2\pi}}

Later we will find the following result useful:

\aeqn{3.13}{\Phi_{m_l}(\phi + \pi) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi}}e^{im_l(\phi + \pi)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi}}e^{im_l\phi}\left(e^{i\pi}\right)^{m_l} = \left(-1\right)^{m_l}\Phi_{m_l}(\phi)}
