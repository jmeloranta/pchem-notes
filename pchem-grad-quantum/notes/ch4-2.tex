\otitle{4.2 Angular momentum observables}

\otext
Earlier we saw that observables are complementary and restricted by the uncertainty relation if their operators do not commute. We just showed that $l_x,l_y,l_z$ do not commute and hence are subject to the uncertainty. However, $l^2$ commutes with $l_x,l_y,l_z$ and allows for accurate simultaneous determination. For example, one can determine $l^2$ and $l_z$ exactly but then $l_x$ and $l_y$ could not be. For this reason we used the ``cone of uncertainty'' in our earlier vector model for angular momentum. The commutation relations can be written in a compact form:

\aeqn{4.9}{l\times l = i\hbar l}

which can be seen by expanding the left hand side cross product and using the previous commutation relations to identify the vector components.
