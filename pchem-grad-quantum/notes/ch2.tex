\textbf{The characteristics of acceptable wavefunctions}

\vspace*{0.2cm}

The Born interpretation implies that wavefunctions must be square integrable and should be made to satisfy the normalization condition:

\aeqn{2.1}{\int\psi^*\psi d\tau = 1}

This implies that the wavefunction cannot become infinte over a finte region in space. It can, however, be infinite in some inifinitesimal region in space (zero measure set), which would not contribute to the value of the integral. Furthermore, $\psi$ must be a function (i.e. it may only have a single value at a given point in space) and have continuous first derivative except in some infinitesimal regions in space.
