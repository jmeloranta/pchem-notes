% Problem 7/2 solution

\underline{Solution:}\\

\noindent
The spin populations ($N_{\alpha}$ and $N_{\beta}$) follow the Boltzmann law (see thermodynamics notes). Since we are at
relatively high temperature, we can approximate the exponential function as $e^x \approx 1 + x$ (first two terms of the Taylor series).
$$\frac{N_{\alpha}}{N_{\beta}} = 1 + \frac{g_N\mu_NB}{kT} = 1 + \frac{(5.585)(5.05\times 10^{-27}\textnormal{ J/T)}(1\textnormal{ T})}{(1.38\times 10^{-23}\textnormal{ J/K})(298\textnormal{ K})} = 1 + 6.86\times 10^{-6}$$
Based on this we have then the difference between the two spin states (normalized by the total number of spins) is:
$$\frac{N_{\alpha} - N_{\beta}}{N_{\alpha} + N_{\beta}} = 3.43\times 10^{-6}$$
(solve for $N_{\alpha}$ in terms of $N_{\beta}$ in the first equation and plug into the second)
