\noindent
2. Proton has a nuclear spin of $1/2$, which means that the degenerate nulcear spin states split into two separate states in the presence of 
external magnetic field. What is the difference between spin populations in the lower vs. upper nuclear spin states for protons 
at 1 T field and room temperature? The $g_N$ value for proton is 5.585. Normalize your answer with respect to the total spin population.\\

3. What is the magnitude of magnetic field that is required for a free electron to have a resonance frequency of 9.500 GHz. 
For free electron $g_e \approx 2.0023$.\\
