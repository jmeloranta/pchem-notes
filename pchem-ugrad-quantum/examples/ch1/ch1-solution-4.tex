% Problem 4/1 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item The probability for measuring $+\hbar k$ is $\cos^2(\chi)$. We have a superposition of the eigenfunctions of momentum and therefore the squares of the coefficients for each eigenfunction give the corresponding probability.
\item The probability for measuring $-\hbar k$ is $\sin^2(\chi)$.
\item Given $\cos^2(\chi) = 0.90$ (hence $\cos(\chi) = \pm 0.95$) we use the normalization condition $\cos^2(\chi) + \sin^2(\chi) = 1$
where we solve for $\sin(\chi) = \pm 0.32$. The overall sign for the wavefunction does not matter and therefore we have two possibilities
for our wavefunction: $\psi = 0.95e^{ikx} \pm 0.32e^{-ikx}$.
\item Normalization condition: $1 = (0.9)^2 + (0.4)^2 + c_3^2$. Thus $c_3 = \pm 0.17$.
\end{enumerate}
