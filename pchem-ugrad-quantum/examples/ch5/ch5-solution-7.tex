\underline{Solution:}\\

\noindent
For Morse potential the dissociation energy is related to $\tilde{\nu}_e$ and $x_e$ as follows (see lecture notes):
$$\tilde{D}_e = \frac{\tilde{\nu}_e}{4x_e}$$
This gives $\tilde{D}_e = 43035.4$ cm$^{-1}$. To get $\tilde{D}_0$ we need to subtract the zero-point energy:
$$\tilde{D}_0 = \tilde{D}_e - \frac{1}{2}h\nu_0 = 41540.4\textnormal{ cm}^{-1} = 496.6\textnormal{ kJ/mol}$$
This is much higher than the known reference value of 431 kJ/mol, which means that Morse potential is not a very accurate model for HCl near the dissociation limit.
