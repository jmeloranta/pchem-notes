% Problem 8/8 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}\\

\noindent
All but C$_2$H$_2$ are non-linear. Therefore both CH$_2$O and C$_6$H$_6$ have 3 rotational degrees of freedom whereas linear C$_2$H$_2$ has only two. The number of vibrational degrees for linear molecules is $3N - 5$ whereas for non-linear it is $3N - 6$. So for C$_2$H$_2$ this is 7, CH$_2$O 6, and C$_6$H$_6$ 30.
