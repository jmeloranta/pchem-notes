% Problem 9/8 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}\\

\noindent
a: The dipole moment does not change. However, the polarizability changes as the size of the molecule changes. Therefore this
mode is not IR active but is Raman active.\\
b: The point group of benzene is $D_{6h}$. The irrep corresponding to this vibration is $B_{2g}$. Since the direct product with
any of the IR transition dipole operators ($x$, $y$, $z$) or Raman ($x^2$, $xy$, etc.) do not belong to this irrep, it is not
possible to get $A_g$ from the overall direct product. Therefore this mode is inactive in both IR and Raman.
