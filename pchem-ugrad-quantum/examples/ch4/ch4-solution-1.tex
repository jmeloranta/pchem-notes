% Problem 4/1 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}\\

\noindent
The operations are: $E$, $C_2$, $C_2'$, $C_2''$, $S_4$, $S_4^3$, $\sigma_v$, $\sigma_v'$.\\
The $C_2$ axis is along C = C = C. The $C_2'$ and $C_2''$ axes are perpendicular to the $C_2$ axis
and are locate long the plane of the paper and perpendicular to the plane.\\
