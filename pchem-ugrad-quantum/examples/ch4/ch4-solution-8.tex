% Problem 4/8 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}\\

\noindent
The $C_2$ axis is along the $z$ axis and the molecule is in the $yz$ plane. The operator $x$ belongs to $B_1$. The ground state
is $A_1$ and by looking at the product table, we can see that the excited state must have $B_1$ symmetry ($B_1\times B_1 = A_1$).
For $y$ ($B_2$) and $z$ ($A_1$) the corresponding excited state symmetries must be $B_2$ and $A_1$, respectively.\\
