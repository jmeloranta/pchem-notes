% Problem 4/5 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}\\

\noindent
Mode 1 is unchanged under any symmetry operation in $C_{2v}$ and hence it has $A_1$ symmetry. The mode would be labelled as $a_1$.\\
Mode 2 is unchanged under any symmetry operation and hence the label is $a_1$.\\
The arrows correspond demonstrate the direction of atomic motion in molecular vibration.\\ 
Mode 3 is unchanged with $E$ and $\sigma_v'(yz)$ and the directions of the arrows get reversed ($-1$) with
$C_2$ and $\sigma_v(xz)$. Thus the mode is labelled as $b_2$.\\
