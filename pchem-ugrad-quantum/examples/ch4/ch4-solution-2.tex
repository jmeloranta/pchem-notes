% Problem 4/2 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}\\

\noindent
The group is Abelian, which means that the order of multiplication does not matter, which simplifies the problem. The products can be worked out as follows:\\

\noindent
Multiplication by $OE$ (the identity operation) always yields $O$ as the result (where $O$ is one of the symmetry operations in $C_{2v}$).
Also operations such as $OO$ give $E$ (rotation and reflection). The only remaining operations are between $C_2$, $\sigma_v(xz)$ and $\sigma_v'(yz)$.
The molecule is taken to reside in $yz$ plane. 

\noindent
Let's consider $C_2\sigma_v$ as an example. To visualize what is happening, think about NO$_2$ molecul and place $p_x$ atomic orbitals on the oxygen
atoms. Note that the $x$ direction is out of the paper plane. $C_2$ will exchange the two oxygens and at the same time flip the $p_x$ orbitals around.
Then $\sigma_v$ reflection just exchanges the oxygens again but without flipping the $p_x$ orbitals. The net effect was to get flip the $p_x$ orbitals.
This same effect may be obtained by $\sigma_v'$ operation and therefore $C_2\sigma_v = \sigma_v'$. The same method can be used to go over all
the remaineng elements in the product table.\\
