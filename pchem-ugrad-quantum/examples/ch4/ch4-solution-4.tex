% Problem 4/4 solution

\underline{Solution:}\\

\noindent
From the character table we can see that both $x$ and $y$ correspond with the $E_{1u}$ irrep. The $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals
behave the same way and belong to $E_{1u}$ as well. By using the same logic, $p_z$ is $A_{2u}$. $s$ orbitals are always spherically
symmetric and hence this is $A_{1g}$. The Cartesian components of $d$ orbitals are: $d_{xz}, d_{yz}, d_{x^2 - y^2}, d_{xy}, d_{z^2}$.
These behave spatially exactly like the spatial operatiors (subscripts). As such. we immediately identify these as:
$E_{1g}$: $d_{xz}, d_{yz}$, $E_{2g}$: $d_{x^2-y^2}, d_{xy}$, and $A_{1g}$: $d_{z^2}$.\\
