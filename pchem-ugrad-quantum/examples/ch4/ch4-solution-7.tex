% Problem 4/7 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}\\

\noindent
Operator $x$ belongs to $E_1$ in $C_{6v}$ (the operator column). Thus the product we need to look at is $A_1\times E_1\times E_2$.
The product table tells us that this is equal to $B_1 + B_2 + E_1$ (a sum of three characters). Since $A_1$ is not present in this
sum, the integral is zero.\\
