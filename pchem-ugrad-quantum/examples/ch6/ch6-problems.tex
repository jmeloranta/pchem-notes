\noindent
1. Consider a diatomic molecule and denote the equilibrium bond lengths for the ground and excited electronic states by $R_e$ and $R_e'$. Given the force constants for both states are equal, calculate the 0-0 transition Franck-Condon factor and show that this transition is most intense when $R_e = R_e'$.\\

\noindent
2. Consider a pulsed laser that operates at 532 nm wavelength, which has 0.10 J energy per pulse and 3.0 ns pulse length.
What is the average power and the number of photons in one pulse?\\

3. N$_2$ molecules are irradiated with 58.43 nm wavelength electromagnetic radiation and it was observed tat the photoelectrons 
ejected had a kinetic energy of 5.63 eV. What was the ionization energy for these electrons? How does this compare with the
ionization energy of N$_2$ and what does it say about the orbital from which the photoelectrons came from?\\

4. Consider vibrationally resolved electronic spectrum of a diatomic molecule. What does the Franck-Condon principle say about
the relative bond lengths between the excited and ground electronic states if there is:
a) just one line, b) one line with a pattern of decaying lower intensity lines, or c) line pattern that first increases in 
intensity and then decays.\\
