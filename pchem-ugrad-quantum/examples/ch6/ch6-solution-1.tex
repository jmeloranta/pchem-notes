\underline{Solution:}\\

We need to calculate the overlap integral ($S$) between the two vibrational wavefunctions that are centered at $R_e$ and $R_e'$:
$$\psi_g = \left(\frac{1}{\alpha\pi^{3/2}}\right)^{1/2}\exp\left(-y^2/2\right)\textnormal{ and }\psi_e = \left(\frac{1}{\alpha\pi^{3/2}}\right)^{1/2}\exp\left(-y'^2/2\right)$$
where $y = (R - R_e)/\alpha$, $y' = (R - R_e')/\alpha$, and $\alpha = \left(\hbar^2/(mk)\right)^{1/4}$. Then the overlap integral
can be written as:
$$S = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\psi_g(R)\psi_e(R)dR = \frac{1}{\pi^{1/2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp\left(-(y^2-y'^2)/2\right)dy$$
Substituting $\alpha z = R - \frac{1}{2}\left(R_e - R'_e\right)$ this becomes (change of variables):
$$S = \frac{1}{\pi^{1/2}}\exp\left(R_e-R'_e\right)/(4\alpha^2)\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp\left(-z^2\right)dz$$
From integral table book we can find that the above integral is equal to $\sqrt{\pi}$ and hence the overalp is:
$$S = \exp\left(R_e - R'_e\right)^2/(4\alpha^2)$$
The Franck-Condon factor obtained by squaring the overlap integral:
$$S^2 = \exp\left(R_e - R'_e\right)^2/(2\alpha^2)$$
This expression reaches maximum value (one) when $R_e = R'_e$ (equal bond lengths).
