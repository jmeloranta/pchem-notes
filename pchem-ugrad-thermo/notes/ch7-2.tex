Recall Eq. (\ref{eq2.40c}): $dw = \phi dQ$ ($\phi$ = potential, $dQ$ = differential charge)

\vspace{0.2cm}

Recall Eq. (\ref{eq4.36}): $dG = -SdT + VdP + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_s} \mu'_idn_i + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_s}\phi_idQ_i$

\vspace{0.2cm}

The change in total charge $Q$ is given by:

\aeqn{7.9}{dQ_i = z_iFdn_i}

where $z_i$ is the charge of species $i$, $F$ is the Faraday constant ($F = N_A \times e$; 96485.309 C mol$^{-1}$), $dn_i$ is the change in the number of ions (mol) and $\phi_i$ is the electric potential of the phase containing species $i$. The prime on the chemical potential signifies the fact that it is the pure chemical potential (i.e., not including the electrical work). Note that $z_i$ is dimensionless where $dQ$ has units of C.

By combining Eqs. (\ref{eq4.36}) and (\ref{eq7.9}) we get:

\vspace{-0.4cm}

\aeqn{7.9a}{dG = -SdT + VdP + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_s}\mu_i'dn_i + F\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_s}z_i\phi_idn_i = -SdT + VdP + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_s}\umark{\left(\mu_i' + Fz_i\phi_i\right)}{\equiv \mu_i}dn_i}

This means that the chemical potential $\mu_i$ can be taken to contain the electrical work as well:

\vspace{-0.3cm}

\aeqn{7.19}{\mu_i = \mu_i' + z_iF\phi_i}

The equilibrium condition Eq. (\ref{eq6.3}) still applies: $\mu_i(\alpha) = \mu_i(\beta)$ for species $i$ and phases $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
