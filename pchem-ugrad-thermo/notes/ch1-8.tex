\otitle{1.8 The principle of corresponding states}

\otext
First we define reduced variables corresponding to $P, T$ and $\bar{V}$ as follows:

\aeqn{1.33c}{P_r = \frac{P}{P_c}, \bar{V}_r = \frac{\bar{V}}{\bar{V}_c}, T_r = \frac{T}{T_c}}

By using these variables, it can be shown that the van der Waals equation becomes:

\aeqn{1.33d}{P_r = \frac{8T_r}{3\bar{V}_r - 1} - \frac{3}{\bar{V}_r^2}}

Note that the gas dependent constants $a$ and $b$ disappeared from the equation. Thus within the van der Waals equation of state, all gases (regadless of their $a$ and $b$ values) should yield identical curves. The compressibility factor for van der Waals equation can also be expressed in reduced units:

\aeqn{1.33e}{Z = \frac{\bar{V}_r}{\bar{V}_r - \frac{1}{3}} - \frac{9}{8\bar{V}_rT_r}}
