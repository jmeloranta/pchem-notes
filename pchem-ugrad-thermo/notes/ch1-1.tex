The most common variables are $P$ (Pressure), $V$ (Volume), $n$ (amount of substance) and
$T$ (Temperature). When $n$ is fixed, two variables need to be specified for a single phase system.
Why is thermodynamic description needed?

\ofig{macro-micro}{0.3}{}

Microscopic definition of a system requires typically large number of variables. One mole of gas molecules would mean more than 6$\times$10$^{23}$ variables!

Molar volume is defined as the ratio between volume $V$ (m$^3$ or dm$^3$ = L) and the number of particles in it $n$ (mol):

\aeqn{X.1}{\bar{V} = \frac{V}{n}}

The amont of substance $n$ (mol) is given by:

\aeqn{X.2}{n = \frac{N}{N_A} = \frac{N}{6.022\times 10^{23}\textnormal{ mol}^{-1}} = \textnormal{``moles of substance''}}

where $N$ is the number of molecules.

\textit{Use SI-units in all calculations. Convert to other units at the final stage.}

At equilibrium a system is described by its thermodynamic variables. \textit{Thermodynamic equation of state} introduces dependencies between the variables. An example of thermodynamic equation of state is the ideal gas law ($PV = nRT$), which allows to express any of the five variables as a function of the remaining ones.
