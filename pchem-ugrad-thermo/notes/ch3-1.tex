The first law of thermodynamics says only that the total energy is conserved but \textit{it does not provide any information as to whether the process can proceed spontaneously.}

\textbf{Example.} Consider gas expanding into vacuum. In practice, we know that the gas will flow from the high pressure chamber into the low pressure chamber.

The first law for this system only states that the total energy is conserved but says nothing about which way the gas would flow.

\textbf{Example.} In practice, we know that some chemical reaction proceed \textit{spontaneously} but some may require heat in order to proceed (\textit{nonspontaneous process})

\vspace*{0.2cm}

\underline{Question:} How do we identify a spontaneous process?

\vspace*{0.2cm}

From the previous examples, it is obvious that a flow of heat is involved in these processes. Heat is, however, not a state function (i.e. $dq$ is not an exact differential). This can be seen by inspecting Eq. (\ref{eq2.45}):

\aeqn{3.1}{dq_{rev} = \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_VdT + \left[P_{ext} + \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T\right]dV}

where we consider reversible heating and $P_{ext} = P$. We will use Eq. (\ref{eq2.22}) as the test for exactness:

\vspace*{-0.2cm}

\aeqn{3.2}{M = \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_V\textnormal{ and }N = P + \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T}

and the required partial derivatives are then ($U$ is well behaving, i.e. derivatives exist and are continuous):

\beqn{3.3}{\left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial V}\right)_T = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial V}\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_V\right)_T = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T\right)_V}
{\left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial T}\right)_V = \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V + \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T\right)_V}

Subtracting the two partial derivatives gives:

\aeqn{3.4}{\left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial T}\right)_V - \left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial V}\right)_T = \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V}

Based on this $dq_{rev}$ would only be exact if $\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V = 0$. \textit{This does not hold even for ideal gases:} $\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V = \frac{nR}{V}$ (from $PV = nRT$). Thus line integral of $dq_{rev}$ depends on the path and $q_{rev}$ is not a state function of the system. Thus it is not useful to consider heat as an indicator for a spontaneity of the process.

\vspace*{0.2cm}

Recall that some times division of an inexact differential by a suitable term (integrating factor) may result in exact differential. In this case it turns out that division by $T$ (temperature) yields an exact differential:

\aeqn{3.5}{\frac{dq_{rev}}{T} = \umark{\frac{(\partial U / \partial T)_V}{T}}{= M}dT + \umark{\left[\frac{P}{T} + \frac{(\partial U / \partial V)_T}{T}\right]}{= N}dV}

By taking the partial derivatives required in the exactness test and subtracting $\left(\partial M / \partial V\right)_T$ from $\left(\partial N / \partial T\right)_V$ (denoted by $\Delta$) we get:

\aeqn{3.6}{\Delta = \frac{1}{T}\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V - \frac{P}{T^2} - \frac{1}{T^2}\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T}

At least for ideal gases $\Delta = 0$ since $\left(\partial U / \partial V\right)_T = 0$ (Joule's experiment) and $PV = nRT$. Thus $dq_{rev} / T$ is exact for ideal gases.

The above expression for $\Delta$ can be derived as follows. First calculate $(\partial N / \partial T)_V$:
$$\left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial T}\right)_V = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left(\frac{P}{T}\right)\right)_V + \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left(\frac{1}{T}\times \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T\right)\right)_V$$
$$= -\frac{1}{T}\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V + \frac{P}{T^2} + \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left(\frac{1}{T}\times \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T\right)\right)_V$$
$$= -\frac{1}{T}\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V + \frac{P}{T^2} - \frac{1}{T^2}\times\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T + \frac{1}{T}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T\right)_V$$

Next we calculate $(\partial M / \partial V)_T$:

$$\left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial V}\right)_T = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial V}\left(\frac{1}{T}\times \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_V\right)\right)_T$$
$$= \frac{1}{T}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial V}\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_V\right)_T = \frac{1}{T}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T\right)_V$$

Subtracting the first expression from the second gives the difference $\Delta$:

$$\Delta = \frac{1}{T}\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V - \frac{P}{T^2} + \frac{1}{T^2}\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T$$

It will turn out that the $dq_{rev} / T$ is the quantity that we are looking for (entropy). It is a useful quantity because it is a state function of the system (no path dependency). Note that we have only shown this to hold for ideal gases, a more detailed consideration will be given later.

\vspace*{0.2cm}

\textbf{Example.} Show that the values of the line integral for $dq_{rev} / T$ are identical along the following paths (ideal gas, reversible processes, $n = 1$; one mole of gas):

\vspace*{0.2cm}

\underline{Closed path 1:}\\
Segment A: ($T_1$, $P_1$, $V_1$) -- ($T_1$, $P_2$, $V_2$) isothermal\\
Segment B: ($T_1$, $P_1$, $V_1$) -- ($T_2$, $P_3$, $V_2$) adiabatic\\
Segment C: ($T_2$, $P_3$, $V_2$) -- ($T_1$, $P_2$, $V_2$) constant volume\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
\underline{Closed path 2:}\\
Segment A: ($T_1$, $P_1$, $V_1$) -- ($T_1$, $P_2$, $V_2$) isothermal\\
Segment D: ($T_1$, $P_1$, $V_1$) -- ($T_3$, $P_1$, $V_2$) constant pressure\\
Segment E: ($T_3$, $P_1$, $V_2$) -- ($T_1$, $P_2$, $V_2$) constant volume\\

\textbf{Solution.} Calculate $dq_{rev} / T$ along each segment. And sum the contributions from each segment.\\

\vspace*{0.2cm}

\underline{Path 1.} (``contribution from A + B + C = 0'')\\

\vspace*{0.2cm}

\textit{Segment A:} The temperature is constant along this path. For an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on the temperature (Eq. (\ref{eq2.69})) and therefore $dU = 0$. Hence along this path (Eq. (\ref{eq2.9})): $dq_{rev} = -dw = PdV = (RT / V) dV$. Division of both sides by $T$ and integration gives:

$$\Delta S = \int\limits_{q_2}^{q_1}\frac{dq_{rev}}{T} = R\int\limits_{V_2}^{V_1}\frac{dV}{V} = R\ln\left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)$$

\textit{Segment B:} Since the change is adiabatic, $dq_{rev} = 0$ and the corresponding line integral over $dq_{rev} / T$ is zero as well.

\vspace*{0.2cm}

\textit{Segment C:} Because volume is constant (``constant volume process''), $dw_{rev} = 0$. The first law (Eqs. (\ref{eq2.9}) and (\ref{eq2.47})) now states that $dq_{rev} = dU = C_V dT$. Division by $T$ and integration along the segment gives:

$$\Delta S = \int\limits_{q_3}^{q_2}\frac{dq_{rev}}{T} = \int\limits_{T_2}^{T_1}\frac{C_V}{T}dT = C_V\int\limits_{T_2}^{T_1}\frac{dT}{T} = C_V\ln\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)$$

Note that $C_V$ is independent of temperature (ideal gas; Eq. (\ref{eq2.71})).

\otext
Summing along the path B + C gives just $C_V \ln(T_1 / T_2)$ and the contribution along A is $R\ln(V_2 / V_1)$. Thus we have (using Eq. (\ref{eq2.82})):

$$\oint dS = \oint\frac{dq_{rev}}{T} = C_V\ln\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right) - R\ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) = 0$$

Note that an alternative form for Eq. (\ref{eq2.82}) is (considering now segment B):

$$\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right) = \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^{R/C_V}$$

\vspace*{0.2cm}

\underline{Path 2.} (``contribution from D + E + A = 0'')\\

\vspace*{0.2cm}

\textit{Segment A}: The same as in the previous path.\\

\vspace*{0.2cm}

\textit{Segment D:} At constant pressure $dq_{rev} / T = dH / T$ (Eq. (\ref{eq2.57})). According to Eq. (\ref{eq2.61}), $dH / T = (C_P / T) dT$. Integration of the expression from $T_1$ to $T_3$ gives ($C_P$ is constant for ideal gases; Eq. (\ref{eq2.72})):

$$\Delta S = \int\limits_{q_1}^{q_3}\frac{dq_{rev}}{T} = \int\limits_{T_1}^{T_3}\frac{C_P}{T}dT = C_P\ln\left(\frac{T_3}{T_1}\right)$$

}

\opage{

\otext
\textit{Segment E:} At constant volume, $dw = 0$. The first law of thermodynamics then gives (Eqs. (\ref{eq2.9}) and (\ref{eq2.47})):

$$\Delta S = \int\limits_{q_3}^{q_1}\frac{dq_{rev}}{T} = \int\limits_{U_3}^{U_1}\frac{dU}{T} = \int\limits_{T_3}^{T_1}\frac{C_V}{T}dT = C_V\ln\left(\frac{T_1}{T_3}\right)\textnormal{ (constant }C_V\textnormal{ assumed)}$$

The total contribution over the closed loop along ``D + E + A'' segments is:

$$\oint dS = \oint\frac{dq_{rev}}{T} = C_P\ln\left(\frac{T_3}{T_1}\right) + C_V\ln\left(\frac{T_1}{T_3}\right) - R\ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)$$
$$= \ln\left(\frac{T_3}{T_1}\right)\times\umark{\left(C_P - C_V\right)}{= R\textnormal{ (Eqs. (\ref{eq2.71}, \ref{eq2.72}))}} - R\ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)$$
$$= R\times\left(\ln\left(\frac{T_3}{T_1}\right) - \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)\right)$$

In order to proceed, we note that the pressure at the end points of segment D is constant. By using the ideal gas law for both end points, we get:

$$\frac{T_3}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{V_1}$$

Thus the logarithm terms cancel and the integral is zero.
