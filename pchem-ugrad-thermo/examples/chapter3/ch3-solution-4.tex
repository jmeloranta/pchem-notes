% Problem 4/3 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}\\

\begin{itemize}

\item[a)] $\Delta S_{\textnormal{H}_2\textnormal{O}} = \frac{q}{T} = \frac{40.69\textnormal{ kJ mol}^{-1}}{373.13\textnormal {K}} = 109.04\textnormal{ J K}^{-1}\textnormal{ mol}^{-1}$. Note that $+$ sign means that water receives heat.

\item[b)] The reservoir loses heat to water exactly the same amount as above. The change in entropy for the heat reservoir is $-q / T = -109.04$ J K$^{-1}$ mol$^{-1}$.

\end{itemize}

Note: Since water $+$ heat reservoir is isolated from the rest of the world, the total change its entropy is 0. The total entropy in the system is conserved.
