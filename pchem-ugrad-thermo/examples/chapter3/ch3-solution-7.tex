% Problem 7/3 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}\\

\begin{itemize}

\item[a)] Change in internal energy is zero because the gas is ideal. Recall that the internal energy for an ideal gas depends only on temperature. Here we have an isothermal process and hence no change in internal energy occurs, $\Delta U = 0$. Note also that the 1st law now states that $q_{rev} = -w_{rev}$. For an isothermal process (see the lecture notes) we have:

$$w_{rev} = -nRT\ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) \Rightarrow q_{rev} = nRT\ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)$$
$$ w_{rev} = -\left(3\textnormal{ mol}\right)\times\left(8.314\textnormal{ J K}^{-1}\textnormal{ mol}^{-1}\right)\times\left(300\textnormal{ K}\right)\ln\left(\frac{300\textnormal{ L}}{90\textnormal{ L}}\right)$$
$$ = -9.01\textnormal{ kJ}$$

and $q_{rev} = 9.01$ kJ. By using the definition of entropy, we can calculate the change in entropy:

$$\Delta S = \frac{q_{rev}}{T} = \frac{9.01\textnormal{ kJ}}{300\textnormal{ K}} = 30.03\textnormal{ J K}^{-1}$$

\item[b)] Divide everything by 3 mol to get per mole quantities:

$$\Delta\bar{U} = 0\textnormal{ kJ mol}^{-1}, \Delta\bar{S} = 10.01\textnormal{ J K}^{-1}\textnormal{ mol}^{-1},$$
$$ w = -3.00\textnormal{ kJ mol}^{-1}, q = 3.00\textnormal{ kJ mol}^{-1}$$

\item[c)] Since the temperature is constant, we have $\Delta\bar{U} = 0$ . Since the gas is expanding into vacuum, $P_{ext} = 0$ and thus $w = 0$. By the first law, $q = 0$. The entropy is the same as in b) because its value depends only on endpoints of the path. Note that $q$ along the present irreversible path cannot be used in calculating entropy -- one must always use a reversible path (for example that in b) above). For this reason $\Delta\bar{S} = 10.01\textnormal{ J K}^{-1}\textnormal{ mol}^{-1}$, which is the same value as in b).

\end{itemize}
