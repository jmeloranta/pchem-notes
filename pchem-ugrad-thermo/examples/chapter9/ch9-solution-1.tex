% Problem 1/9 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}

Approximately halfway between 23.0 hr and 31.5 hr $\left[\textnormal{A}\right]\approx 0.5$. Thus the half-life is 27.3 hr or about $10^5$ s. More accurate results could be obtained by fitting the integrated form of the 1st order rate equation to the kinetic data. The relation between $t_{1/2}$ and $k_1$ is:

$$k_1 = \frac{\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = \frac{\ln(2)}{10^5\textnormal{ s}} \approx 7\times 10^{-6}\textnormal{ s}^{-1}$$
