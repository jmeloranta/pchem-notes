\item Metallic sodium reacts with water according to:

$$2\textnormal{Na} + \textnormal{H}_2\textnormal{O} \rightarrow 2\textnormal{NaOH} + \textnormal{H}_2$$

\item Show that the differential $d$f is inexact ($a,b,c$ are constants).

$$df = \left(2ax^2 + bxy\right)dx + \left(bx^2 + 2cxy\right)dy$$

Does the corresponding line integral depend on the path? Furthermore, show that differential $df / x$ is exact.

\item Show that the following differential is inexact:

$$df = \left(y^2 - xy\right)dx - x^2dy$$

Test the integrating factor $\frac{1}{xy^2}$ to see if it produces an exact differential.

\item The state of monoatomic ideal gas ($n = 1$ mol) is changed reversibly as follows:

where 1, 2, 3 and 4 refer to states and A, B and C to processes. Process A is isothermal, B is isobaric and C is isochoric. The cycle is described by the attached graph.

\item The heat capacities of a gas may be represented by the Shomate equation (see the NIST Chemistry Webbook):

$$\bar{C}_P = \alpha + \beta T + \gamma T^2 + \delta T^3 + \frac{\eta}{T^2}$$

For N$_2$ gas (between 298 K and 6000 K), $\alpha = 26.09200$ J K$^{-1}$ mol$^{-1}$, $\beta = 8.218801\times 10^{-3}$ J K$^{-2}$ mol$^{-1}$, $\gamma = -1.976141\times 10^{-6}$ J K$^{-3}$ mol$^{-1}$, $\delta = 0.159274\times 10^{-9}$ J K$^{-4}$ mol$^{-1}$ and $\eta = 0.044434\times 10^{6}$ J K mol$^{-1}$.

\item One gram of liquid benzene is burned in an adiabatic bomb calorimeter. The temperature before ignition was 20.826 $^\circ$C, and the temperature after the combustion was 25.000 $^\circ$C. The heat capacity of the bomb, the water around it, and the contents of the bomb before the combustion was 10 000 J K$^{-1}$. Calculate $\Delta_fH^\circ$ for C$_6$H$_6(l)$ at 298.15 K from these data. Assume that the water produced in the combustion is in the liquid state, the carbon dioxide produced in the combustion is in the gas state and all gases

$$2\textnormal{C}_6\textnormal{H}_6(l) + 15\textnormal{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 12\textnormal{CO}_2(g) + 6\textnormal{H}_2\textnormal{O}(l)$$
