% Problem 2/2 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}\\

Differential $df = Mdx + Ndy$ is exact if $\left(\frac{\partial N(x,y)}{\partial x}\right)_y = \left(\frac{\partial M(x,y)}{\partial y}\right)_x$. Here we have:

$$M = 2ax^2 + bxy\textnormal{ and }N = bx^2 + 2cxy$$

$$\left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\right)_x = bx\textnormal{ and }\left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}\right)_y = 2bx + 2cy$$

Because the partial derivatives are not equal, the differential is inexact. Line integrals for inexact differentials depend on path in general. For $df / x$ we have:

$$M = 2ax + by\textnormal{ and }N = bx + 2cy$$

$$\left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\right)_x = b\textnormal{ and }\left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}\right)_y = b$$

Because the partial derivatives are equal, differential $df / x$ is exact.
