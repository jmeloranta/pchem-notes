% Problem 9/4 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}\\

\begin{itemize}

\item[a)] $w = -P\Delta V = -P(V_{fin} - V_{init}) = -(RT - 0) = -(8.314\textnormal{ J K}^{-1}\textnormal{ mol}^{-1})$ $\times (384\textnormal{ K}) = -3193\textnormal{ J mol}^{-1}$. The final volume was obtained from the ideal gas law ($PV = nRT$).

\item[b) and c)] For vaporization process we have $q = \Delta\bar{H} = (361.9\textnormal{ J g}^{-1})\times (92.13\textnormal{ g mol}^{-1}) = 33.340\textnormal{ kJ mol}^{-1}$.

\item[d)] $\Delta\bar{U} = q + w = (33340\textnormal{ J mol}^{-1}) + (-3193\textnormal{ J mol}^{-1}) = 30.147\textnormal{ kJ mol}^{-1}$. Note that if ideal gas
behavior was assumed here, $\Delta U$ would have been zero as it would depend only on temperature.

\item[e) and f)] $G = U + PV - TS$ and hence $\Delta G = \Delta U + V\Delta P + P\Delta V - T\Delta S - S\Delta T$. At constant temperature and pressure $\Delta P = \Delta T = 0$ and therefore $\Delta G = \Delta U + P\Delta V - T\Delta S$. From part a) $P\Delta V = 3193$ J mol$^{-1}$ and we need to calculate $\Delta S$. $\Delta S = q_{rev} / T = (33.340\textnormal{ kJ mol}^{-1}) / (384\textnormal{ K}) = 86.8\textnormal{ J K}^{-1}\textnormal{ mol}^{-1}$. And finally $\Delta G = 0$ by combining all the required terms.

\end{itemize}
