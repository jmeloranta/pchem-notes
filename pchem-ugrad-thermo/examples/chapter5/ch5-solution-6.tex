% Problem 6/5 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}

First we note that this equation is very similar to that given in the lecture notes (see the Maxwell equations). Now $\Delta_rG$ corresponds to $\mu_i$ and $\xi$ to $n_i$:

$$\umark{-\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial\xi}\right)_{T,P}}{=\Delta_rS} = \left(\frac{\partial\left(\Delta_rG\right)}{\partial T}\right)_{\xi,P}\textnormal{ and } \umark{\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial \xi}\right)_{T,P}}{=\Delta_rV} = \left(\frac{\partial\left(\Delta_rG\right)}{\partial P}\right)_{\xi,T}$$

Thus by calculating derivatives of the reaction Gibbs energy with respect to temperature and pressure, we can obtain values for $\Delta_rS$ and $\Delta_rV$. $\Delta_rH$ is directly given by: $\Delta_rH = \Delta_rG - T\left(\partial\Delta_rG / \partial T\right)_P$.
