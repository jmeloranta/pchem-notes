% Problem 4/5 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}

\begin{enumerate}

\item First calculate the partial pressures and the equilibrium constant under the known conditions (activity of pure solid is one): 

$$P_{\textnormal{CO}_2} = \left(30.4\textnormal{ bar}\right)\times\left(17\%\right) = 5.2\textnormal{ bar}$$
$$P_{\textnormal{CO}} = \left(30.4\textnormal{ bar}\right)\times\left(83\%\right) = 25.2\textnormal{ bar}$$
$$K = \frac{\left(P_{\textnormal{CO}}/P^\circ\right)^2}{\left(P_{\textnormal{CO}_2} / P^\circ\right)} = \frac{\left(25.2\right)^2}{5.2} = 122$$

Let $\xi$ be the extent of reaction. The amount of CO$_2$(g) is given by $1-\xi$ and CO(g) by $2\xi$. The mole fractions as a function of $\xi$ are then:

$$y_{\textnormal{CO}_2} = \frac{1-\xi}{1+\xi}\textnormal{ and }y_{\textnormal{CO}} = \frac{2\xi}{1+\xi}$$

Since we have ideal gases, the partial pressures are given by $P_{\textnormal{CO}_2} = y_{\textnormal{CO}_2}P$ and $P_{\textnormal{CO}} = y_{\textnormal{CO}}P$. By inserting these into the expression for the equilibrium constant, we get (activity of the solid is one):

$$K = \frac{\left(P_{\textnormal{CO}} / P^\circ\right)^2}{\left(P_{\textnormal{CO}_2}/P^\circ\right)} = \left(\frac{P}{P^\circ}\right)\times\frac{4\xi^2}{1-\xi^2}$$

Since $K = 122$ and $P/P^\circ = 20.3$, we can calculate $\xi = 0.77$. When this is inserted into the expression for CO$_2$ molar fraction above, we get $y_{\textnormal{CO}_2} = 0.13$. Thus 13\% of CO$_2$ at 20.3 bar.

\item This does not affect the reaction at all as the partial pressures of the components do not change. If the volume would change then this would affect the reaction.

\item If 25\% is CO$_2$ then the rest is CO (75\%). This gives:

$$K = \frac{\left(0.75\left(P/P^\circ\right)\right)^2}{0.25\left(P/P^\circ\right)} \Rightarrow P = 54\textnormal{ bar}$$

\end{enumerate}
