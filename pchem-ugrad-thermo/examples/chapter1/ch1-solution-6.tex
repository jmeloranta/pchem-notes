% Problem 6/1 solution
\noindent
\underline{Solution:}\\

The equations in the lecture notes can be rewritten as (the definition of critical point and the equation of state):

$$\frac{RT_c}{\left(\bar{V}_c - b\right)^2} = \frac{2a}{\bar{V}_c^3}$$
$$\frac{2RT_c}{\left(\bar{V}_c - b\right)^3} = \frac{6a}{\bar{V}_c^4}$$
$$P_c = \frac{RT_c}{\bar{V}_c - b} - \frac{a}{\bar{V}_c^2}$$

Division of the first equation by the second (side by side) yields $\bar{V}_c = 3b$. Substitution of this expression into the first equation above gives $T_c = \frac{8a}{27Rb}$. Substitution of the two previous equations into the last equation above yields $P_c = 
\frac{a}{27b^2}$. Note that the van der Waals constants $a$ and $b$ are usually calculated using the critical temperature and pressure since they are typically known more accurately than the critical volume.
