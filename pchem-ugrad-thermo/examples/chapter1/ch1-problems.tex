\begin{enumerate}
\item When 0.12 g of solid iodine was vaporized at 1670 K, the resulting gas displaced 20.2 cm$^3$ of dry air at 298 K and 99.9 kPa pressure. How many iodine molecules were dissociated (i.e. as atomic iodine) in the gas? The gas phase equilibrium reaction is:

$$\textnormal{I}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\textnormal{I}(g)$$

Assume that the gas mixture (of I$_2$ and I) behave according to the ideal gas law.

\item What is the molar volume of $n$-hexane at 660 K and 91 bar according to (a) the ideal gas law and (b) the van der Waals equation? For $n$-hexane, $T_c$ = 507.7 K and $P_c$ = 30.3 bar. If you obtain an equation that you cannot solve analytically, attempt to solve it
numerically.

\item The critical temperature of gaseous ammonia is 406 K and the critical pressure is 113 bar. Use the van der Waals equation to predict its molar volume at 273 K and 1 bar. Hint: Calculate first the coefficients $a$ and $b$, then write the equation for the molar
volume: $V = \frac{RT}{P + a / \bar{V}^2} + b$. Guess an initial value for the molar volume and obtain a new value from the equation. Place the obtained value in the equation again to get a new value. Repeat this procedure until the value does not change anymore. This is an example of iterative methods for solving equations.
